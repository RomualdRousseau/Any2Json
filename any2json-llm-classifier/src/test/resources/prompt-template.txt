Given the following CSV:

{CSV}

Given the following YAML definiton:

{DEF}


Give me the list of headers of the csv that match the definition.
The result must be a json object with the name in the definition as key and the original header name as value.

Example:
{
	"date": Date",
	"customer_code": "Customer Code",
	...
}
