You are an assitant helping me to tag the columns of interest of a document.

Given the following CSV sample:

{CSV}

Given the following YAML definiton:

{DEF}

Question:
Give me the list of headers of the csv that match the definition, using the description and example to guide you?

Output:
The result must be a json object with the original header name as key and the name in the definition as value.

Example:
{
	"INVOICE DATE": date",
	"SOLD TO CODE": "customer_code",
	...
}
