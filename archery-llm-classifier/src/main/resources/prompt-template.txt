You are an assistant helping me to tag the columns of interest in a CSV document.

Given the following sample of the CSV document:

{CSV}

Given the following YAML definition:

{DEF}

Question:
List of headers of the csv that best match the definitions using exclusively its description and example?

Output:
Your answer must be a json object with the original header name as key and the name in the definition as value.

Example:
{
	"INVOICE DATE": "date",
    "CUSTOMER CODE": "customer_code",
	...
}
